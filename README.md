Learn OpenUSD is a full learning path to prepare developers for the OpenUSD Development Certification. This open source repository is open to contributions to improve the learning experience for everyone and so that teachers and trainers can take it and adapt it for their audiences.

## Configuration

### uv
This repository uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. If you're new to uv, you don't need to know much more than the commands we use in the [build instructions](#How-to-Build). We recommend [installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Git LFS
This repository uses Git Large File Storage to store images, videos, and USD content. To ensure a frictionless process, make sure you have it installed before cloning the repository.

**Install:**
```
git lfs install
```

## How to Build
1. `uv run sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/`
1. `uv run python -m http.server 8000 -d docs/build/html/`
1. In a web browser, open `http://localhost:8000`
