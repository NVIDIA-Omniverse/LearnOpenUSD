```{admonition} A Note About LIVERPS vs LIVRPS
OpenUSD recently introduced a new {term}`composition arc <Composition Arcs>` called "**{term}`relocates <Relocate>`**," which is now included in the {term}`strength ordering <LIVERPS Strength Ordering>` acronym. What was previously known as **LIVRPS** is now **LIVERPS**, with the "E" representing rElocates. Learn OpenUSD will be updated soon to cover relocates, but for now, please note that you may see both LIVRPS and LIVERPS used interchangeably.
