# Asset Parameterization

In this lesson, you’ll learn about {term}`asset <Asset>` parameterization in OpenUSD, which enables the reuse of content by allowing certain fields and {term}`properties <Property>` to vary downstream. Here’s what we’ll accomplish:

* Explain the purpose and benefits of asset parameterization in OpenUSD  
* Differentiate between {term}`variants <Variant>` and {term}`primvars <Primvar>` as parameterization methods  
* Organize our assets
