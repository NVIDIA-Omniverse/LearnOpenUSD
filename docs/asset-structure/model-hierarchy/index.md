# Model Hierarchy

In this lesson you’ll learn about organizing {term}`assets <Asset>` into logical structures using OpenUSD’s {term}`model hierarchy <Model Hierarchy>` system. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

* Explain the role of model hierarchies in organizing OpenUSD assets  
* Structure assets using nested model hierarchies  
* Leverage {term}`kinds <Kind>` to effectively traverse model hierarchies
