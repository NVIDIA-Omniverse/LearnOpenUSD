# Encapsulation

Welcome to the lesson on encapsulation, where we’ll explore the concept of encapsulation in OpenUSD. By the end of this lesson, we’ll be able to:

- Define encapsulation in the context of USD and explain its importance in {term}`asset <Asset>` creation.
- Implement proper encapsulation techniques when creating USD assets.
- Use default {term}`prims <Prim>` effectively to improve asset reusability.

Here is an outline for this lesson:
