Let's continue with the last lesson in this module, *{term}`LIVERPS Strength Ordering <LIVERPS Strength Ordering>`*. LIVERPS is a fundamental concept in USD that governs how different {term}`composition arcs <Composition Arcs>` are applied when creating a scene. This knowledge is key to understanding how USD resolves conflicts in {term}`opinions <Opinions>` and determines the final state of a scene when multiple {term}`layers <Layer>` and composition operations are involved.

In this module, we will:

- Understand the meaning of the LIVERPS acronym.
- Learn about the hierarchy of composition arcs and their relative strengths.
- Explore the concept of {term}`layer stacks <Layer Stack>` and how they relate to LIVERPS.
- Gain insight into how LIVERPS determines the {term}`composition <Composition>` of {term}`prims <Prim>` and {term}`properties <Property>` on a USD {term}`stage <Stage>`.
