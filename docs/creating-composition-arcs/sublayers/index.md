In this lesson we’ll dive into the fundamental concepts of {term}`sublayers <Sublayer>`, which form the backbone of USD’s {term}`composition <Composition>` system. In this module, we will:

- Define {term}`layers <Layer>` and sublayers in the context of OpenUSD, and explain their roles in scene composition.
- Identify when and why to use sublayers in USD workflows.
- Create and manipulate sublayers using usdview and Python.
- Implement sublayers to organize USD content from multiple workstreams effectively.
- Debug and troubleshoot sublayer composition using usdview’s *Layer Stack* view.
