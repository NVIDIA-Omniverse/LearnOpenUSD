# Asset Modularity and Instancing

This module, *Asset Modularity and Instancing*, we will explore the principles and practical workflows of asset modularity, instancing, and content reuse in OpenUSD. Through guided exercises and real-world scenarios, participants will build modular asset hierarchies using OpenUSD’s model kinds and composition arcs and leverage scenegraph instances and point instancers to build efficient and scalable 3D scenes.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

* Explain the concept of instancing in OpenUSD and its relationship to the composition system
* Implement instanceable prims and understand the creation of implicit prototypes
* Create and manage point instancing for efficient asset scattering
* Design nested instancing hierarchies for complex scene structures
* Utilize variant sets to implement geometric and material variations in instanceable assets
* Analyze and optimize scene performance using instancing techniques
* Apply instancing strategies to real-world production scenarios, such as creating large-scale environments
